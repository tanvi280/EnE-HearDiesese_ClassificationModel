Heart Disease Prediction Machine Learning Model
Problem Definition
Financial institutions receive thousands of loan applications daily. Manually evaluating these applications is time-consuming, prone to human error, and may lead to inconsistent decisions. To address this, a machine learning system is needed to automatically predict whether a loan should be approved based on the applicant's profile. To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the presence of heart disease in a patient based on medical attributes and clinical data.

Problem Statement:
Cardiovascular diseases are among the leading causes of death globally. Early detection of heart disease can significantly improve treatment outcomes and reduce mortality rates. However, manual diagnosis is time-consuming and prone to human error. To address this, we aim to build a machine learning-based system that can assist healthcare professionals by predicting the likelihood of heart disease using patient data.

Input:
A structured dataset containing various medical attributes such as:

Age

Gender

Chest pain type

Resting blood pressure

Cholesterol levels

Fasting blood sugar

Resting ECG results

Max heart rate achieved

Exercise-induced angina

ST depression

Number of major vessels

Thalassemia

Output:
A binary classification:

1: Presence of heart disease

0: No presence of heart disease
